1. redirect output

2. setting err_msg - some in comments (insertAlias)

3. metacharacters
	* created a token.c file to read quotes and metacharacters. will push once i implement into shell.c

4. piping - only for non built-ins so figure those out first

5. & - running in background

6. redirecting error

7. 2.3 - other commands section to check what needs to be done for redirection, piping, etc

8. segmentation fault when running printenv 
	* krystals working on it
		
9. ERROR: pwd command is sometimes printing the path next to the >> cursor and reading the following command without >> cursor
	(try typing pwd twice in a row to see error)
		* I haven't noticed this - Greg
